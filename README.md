# Movie Success Prediction with Dataming

## What's this project all about?
This Django based web-app uses an AI model to predict movie ratings of a new planned movie based on production detail varibles, such as movie budget, which actors will it feature and how many awards have they won, genre of the movie, it's run time, etc ect
It then generates the estimated rating out of 10

The AI model was trained on a dataset of over 10'000 movie details. The dataset was a combination of downloaded datasets from Keggle and IMDb. Other detials which were not included in the datasets, such as how many oscard and other awards did each actor have, were mined from IMDb pages.
